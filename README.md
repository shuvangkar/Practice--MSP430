## MSP430
The target of the repo is to share my current status of learning MSP430 low power microcontroller. 

## Compiler Support 
1. It has GCC Compiler for MSP430 and MSP432. It is completely opensource so has no code limitation.
2. TI Compiler with Code Composer Studio. Free upto 16KB of Flash.
3. IAR Embedded workbench for MSP430. Free upto 4KB of Flash.
4. Energia IDE brings the Arduino framework to the Texas Instrument 

Note : On average the TI compiler often provides about a 15% code size and performance improvement, as compared to using the free GCC compiler for MSP430;
